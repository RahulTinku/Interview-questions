1. useMemo - What it is and why it is used? Does this increase performance or reduces it by extensive uses?
2. Difference in <> & React.Fragment - In React.Fragment you can use {key} while iterating but not in <>
   eg.

```jsx
return (
  <Fragment key={item.id}>
    <h1>{item.name}</h1>
    <p>{item.description}</p>
  </Fragment>
);
```
